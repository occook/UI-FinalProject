The heat in July is unrelenting and during the days the temperature was between 35 and 40 degrees celcius.The rooftop pool at this hotel is the ideal place to cool down after a day sightseeing and although small and fairly crowded, especially over the weekend, the lifeguard/pool attendant and the 2 bar staff were very friendly and always helpful and attentive. The breakfast I thought was outstanding with a wide range of hot and cold things to choose from including fried and scrambled eggs sausage right through to croissants fresh fruit and plenty of continental style cold meats cheeses and even cakes and puddings.')">

Klaustur has a nice environment, very comfortable, with good mixology, especially if youre a G&T fan. We spent each afternoon there unwinding from excursions with children. Met some amazing people, like DonByrd, an American expat tending bar and being cool. It appeared to be popular with locals at times, was nearly mauled by a pack of local cougars while bringing a drink to my wife. We love this place, cant wait to return.')">
