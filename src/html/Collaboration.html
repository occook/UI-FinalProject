The breakfast I thought was outstanding with a wide range of hot and cold things to choose from including fried and scrambled eggs sausage right through to croissants fresh fruit and plenty of continental style cold meats cheeses and even cakes and puddings.')">

Met some amazing people, like DonByrd, an American expat tending bar and being cool. It appeared to be popular with locals at times, was nearly mauled by a pack of local cougars while bringing a drink to my wife. We love this place, cant wait to return.')">
