# UI-FinalProject
Final User Interfaces Project

We will divide this project by the different pages inside the website.  There are several different pages, so each of us will have a good amount of work to complete our parts. The difficulty of this assignment is not making the pages, but making sure that each of our webpages communicate properly with each other, and are designed similarly.  Ana stresses that design is a big part of the grading for this assignment, so our CSS files need to be extremely similar in order to pull this off.

A few things that will make this easier.
1) We are allowed to make every webpage on a different HTML file. That means we don't need to make those giant, disorganized paragraphs of HTML in our JavaScript files.
	- This means that every webpage you make should have its own HTML file.
	- MAKE HTML FILE NAMES UNIQUE BECAUSE WE WILL BE PUTTING LINKS BETWEEN ALL OF THE HTML FILES!!!!
2) We are also allowed to make our own CSS and JavaScript files for each of these HTML files.
	- This is where things get a little more tough. If all of our CSS files look different, then our website will look a lot worse. Luckily, there should be a way of keeping everything organized.
	

HOW DO WE KEEP CONSISTENT CSS?
What we can do is create one CSS file that we will call "style.css". This will hold large, overarching rules that will keep colors and everything similar.

What rules should we expect to be in this "style.css" stylesheet?
Background-color
Text-color
Text-font
Rules on elements (anything that doesn't have a class or id).

Every single webpage that we make will load this css stylesheet. This is one of the first things that you need to include in your HTML file because then you will see how your html reacts to the CSS.

After you load "style.css" you can make your own separate stylesheet. Imagine I make a stylesheet called "header.css", this will come after, thus having the ability to overwrite any rule in "style.css". However, I highly recommend that you don't overwrite anything, and only make CSS rules on id's and classes. 

On that same note, every single element in your HTML file should have a MAXIMUM OF 1 ID. You can have as many classes as you want, but only have ONE ID. These ID's and classes should also be really descriptive. I know it's frustrating to have an ID that's 4 words long, but it will really help you keep everything organized for you.

The first step is to divide up all of the work, and making this first CSS file. Brooke and I will make the first webpage, and thus determine what rules should be in our large CSS file, hopefully making things a little easier for you guys. 

Also really recommend that you guys look at "style.css" when it is complete. That way you get a sense for what new rules we make. Also then you can give advice on whether or not a rule should be included in "style.css"

If you have any questions or concerns, put it in the Whatsapp. That will be the easiest way to contact the group and get answers to your questions. Github is not a very good place for messaging. And yeah, take a look at the prototype and see which webpages look similar. For example, the same person should probably work on the login and register pages because they look so similar, so a lot of code can be copied.
